>[!hint] This lab supports the **Redirect Clipboard** and +++TypeText+++ functions.
>
> With **Redirect Clipboard**, you can easily copy and paste blocks of code and other strings from the instructions and from other locations on the VM from your local clipboard directly to the VM.  You may need to click **Allow** in your browser to allow access to your local clipboard.
>
> Due to an issue in Azure Cloudshell, you need to use the right-click and paste mouse command instead of CTRL+V when you're in the VM.  This method allows you to copy text from the VM and from your local machine.
